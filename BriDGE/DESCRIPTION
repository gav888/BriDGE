Description: A comprehensive package for causal analysis of randomized controlled 
    trial (RCT) data. BriDGE provides tools for causal discovery using structure 
    learning algorithms, mediation analysis with nonlinear relationships through 
    Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification, 
    sensitivity analysis, and rich visualization capabilities. The package is 
    designed to be user-friendly and agnostic to specific data structures, making 
    it suitable for researchers across various domains who need to understand 
    causal mechanisms in experimental data. Key features include support for 
    multiple mediators, parallel processing for computational efficiency, and 
    integrated diagnostic tools for model validation.
